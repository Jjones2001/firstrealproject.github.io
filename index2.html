         <a>Most of the focus concerning the Holocaust/Hitler’s time as leader of Germany is on the massacre of the Jewish and other non-Aryan people.
            But I want to bring to light the things Hitler might have done to benefit his country. To be perfectly clear, I’m NOT studying the Holocaust.
             I’m studying the effects of Hitler’s decisions on the country, and how it helped and hindered them, short and long term.

God. No matter how hard I try to describe it, It’s going to come out sounding like I didn’t think the Holocaust was that horrible, or that Hitler wasn’t a bad guy.
 Ugh. Here we go.</a>
